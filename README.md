# Factors-Influencing-University-Rankings-using-Advanced-Data-Analysis-Techniques

## In this project, I have attempted to research an interesting problem:
### Which factors most influence the world ranking of a university
*I have used the CWUR - 2015 dataset. The data has 1000 rows for universities and has over 11 attributes such as National rank, publications, citations, quality of education etc.*

How to run the code: 

The main file to open in browser after creating a local server is assignment2.html. All other
HTML files will be called from within the assignment2.html

Enter the following command into the command line:

> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

This command creates a local host at port 8000. Simply open this port in your favourite web-browser by navigating to localhost:8000 and click on assignment2.html to view the project.

Here is a demo of the project in action:
